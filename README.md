__Project type__: 3D 

__Notes__:
 - wip

# Key things learned
 - how to add packages
  - it was added a package for a circular section to build the complete helix
 - how to pin the objetive of the camara to a game object.
 - rotate an object using the mouse control 
 - how to store player status and start new game with the last status
 - If "Is Trigger" option is true in a box collider, then it will ignore the physics
  - this is useful to allow the ball to traspass the boxcollider in each level
 - How to change the color by code
 - Get the collisioner object asking directly to collision.transform.GetComponent<expectedType>
  - if its null means the collisioner object was diferent from the expected type
